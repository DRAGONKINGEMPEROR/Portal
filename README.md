# Portal
A mixed reality application that projects a portal in  the real world

## Overview
Portal is an application developed to experience Mixed Reatily technology. In this application, two worlds are mixed together to give an immersive experience of VR in the real world. The word "portal" itself suggests the fictional space time passway to different dimension like in any Sci-fi movie. Here in this application user would be able to send and interact with objects through the portal. 


## Mixed Reality

Mixed reality (MR), sometimes referred to as hybrid reality, is the merging of real and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time. Mixed reality takes place not only in the physical world or the virtual world, but is a mix of reality and virtual reality, encompassing both augmented reality and augmented virtuality via immersive technology. The first immersive mixed reality system, providing enveloping sight, sound, and touch was the Virtual Fixtures platform developed at the U.S. Air Force's Armstrong Laboratories in the early 1990s. In a study published in 1992, the Virtual Fixtures project at the U.S. Air Force demonstrated for the first time that human performance could be significantly amplified by the introduction of spatially registered virtual objects overlaid on top of a person's direct view of a real physical environment.

## Motivation

Since the release of ArKit 1.5 virtical plane detection feature became a trending topic among AR developers. And then people started posting their work and someone anonymousely posted a clip showing a glimpse of a portal door like Doremon's anywhere door. This made me crazy, I said I want to make it. So, scratching my brain up and learning on the way, I made this application.

###### Apple ArKit

ARKit, Apple's augmented reality (AR) technology, delivers immersive, engaging experiences that seamlessly blend virtual objects with the real world. In AR apps, the device's camera presents a live, onscreen view of the physical world. Three-dimensional virtual objects are superimposed over this view, creating the illusion that they actually exist. The user can reorient their device to explore the objects from different angles and, if appropriate for the experience, interact with objects using gestures and movement.
